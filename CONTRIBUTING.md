## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to CodePal:

* **Bug reports:** If you find a bug in the code, please report it by creating an issue on the GitHub repository. Be sure to include clear steps to reproduce the bug.
* **Feature requests:** If you have an idea for a new feature, please create an issue on the GitHub repository. Describe the feature in detail and explain how it would benefit users.
* **Pull requests:** If you've fixed a bug or implemented a new feature, you can submit a pull request. Before submitting a pull request, please:
    * Make sure your code follows the style guide (if applicable).
    * Rebase your branch onto the latest master branch before submitting the pull request.

## Code Style

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style. You can find the ESLint configuration in the `.eslintrc.json` file. We recommend using a linter extension for your code editor to help you catch style issues as you code.
